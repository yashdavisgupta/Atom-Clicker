# Atom-Clicker
This is a Shiny new project I've been working on for about a week as sort of a cathartic break.

The current goal of this project is to create a rather unique clicker game. The game itself is really simple but I hope to explore 3D webgl, UX and UI choices, and most importantly the logic behind the simple physics of the atom.
